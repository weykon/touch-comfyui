this is checkpoint that i mix it from various models and LORAs to create best pixel art image.
best resolution at 512x512, 768x768, 1024x1024, 512x768, 768x512 but feel free to experiment.

use pixelart extension to downscale to 8 and upscaling again for more authentic pixel look.

for Fast Mode version, the cfg scale need to be 1 or 2 and minimum step is 4 or 8 or else the image will look worse.
